## Class Assignments

We will be using Gradescope this term, which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. All assigned work will be submitted through Gradescope, and assignment and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope. As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your Gradescope login is your Make School email, and your password can be changed at <https://gradescope.com/reset_password>. The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.

### Tutorials

To access each tutorial, **click the bold links** below. Be sure to complete the exercise in your browser and follow each instruction carefully.

| Name | Description | Due Date |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| **[Pete's Pets]** | _Add common features to improve an existing codebase._ | **Due 11/16 @ 11:59PM** |
| **[Make Chat]** | _Create your very own live messaging application!_ |  **Due 11/30 @ 11:59PM** |

**PLEASE NOTE**: _All tutorials and projects require a minimum of 10 commits, and must take place throughout the time allotted for the project's completion, not just at the end. Failure to include more than 10 commits will lead to not getting credit for the project and having to redo it._

**Your final presentation will be evaluated based on the [Make School Presentation Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WTLcZNyvRGYDz5L8Kr8a0ILbFAyr92u85paoqGFjxPg/edit). You must earn an average of 2.5 on the rubric to pass**.

## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- **Complete both** the **[Pete's Pets]** and **[Make Chat]** tutorials and submit your code on [Gradescope].
- **Submit all three [challenges](#challenges)** on [Gradescope].
- **Deliver a [final presentation](#final-presentation)** on the last day of class.
- Actively **participate in class** and **abide by the attendance policy**.
- **Make up all classwork** from all absences.

## Academic Honesty Policy

At Make School, we highly encourage collaboration between students on assignments. Working with other people is the best way to learn!

However, there's a big difference between **collaboration** (writing code together with another person) and **plagiarism** (copying code from a classmate or outside source without providing proper attribution).

Here are some guidelines to follow in order to avoid plagiarism:

1. If you are looking at an outside source for help, **close the window** containing the code before writing your own solution.
1. Do not write down a line of code unless you **completely understand** how it works. (This is true even if the source you're referencing is the lesson slides/examples/etc!)
1. If your code is still similar to an outside source or another student's, **provide attribution** by adding a comment to your code explaining where it was taken from.

We take academic honesty very seriously at Make School. The consequences for violating the policy are as follows:

- You will be required to write a [Self-Reflection Letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/140_PHfDh7gu33OZI_caxEtvNzAlAepjnGcbQcXZ-MRo/edit?usp=sharing) to reflect on how your actions affected others.
- If this is your first offense, you may be permitted to redo the assignment for a reduced grade (at the instructor's discretion).
- The incident will be added to your permanent record at Make School and you may be placed on a Participation Improvement Plan (PIP).

For subsequent offenses, more serious consequences may be considered. For more information, please see [Make School's academic honesty policy](https://make.sc/academic-honesty-policy).
