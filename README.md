# BEW 2.1 - Advanced Web Patterns in Node.js

## Course Description

We've learned a lot about the web; the common conventions and we've mastered authentication and authorization. Now pretty much you can sort through whatever someone asked for. However, there are a few extra features that are quite conventional that you have not gained mastery over yet. Those tricky features can stymie a novice engineer who doesn't know what tools and patterns they have available to them. For example, simple and full text search, uploading files and images, sending emails

For all in class work, you will be using a clone of the pet store starter project called [Proud Pete's Pet Emporium](https://github.com/Product-College-Labs/petes-pets). You must implement ALL the patterns in this class. If you miss class or do not complete the implementation in class, please do the work as homework. At the end of the class, you're pet store must be completely full featured.

## People's Choice

We will have 4 classes on topics that the group chooses. During these classes we will work together to survey the topic, discuss the possiblities and limitations of the technology, and get a "hello world" working on our computers. Here are a few examples of topics we could cover:

* SQL
* IoT
* Amazon hosting
* Sending Texts
* Blockchain & DAPPs
* ???
* async/await, turning callback => promise
* Generators & Decorators
