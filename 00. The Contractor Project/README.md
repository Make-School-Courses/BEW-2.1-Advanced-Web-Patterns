# The Contractor Project

## Introduction

Hi there, imagine you're part of a team of four software contractors and you have contracted with a client to build a new project.

Who is the client? Your lovely instructor!

## How It Works

Interview the client (that rascally instructor) to see what they'd like you to build. They will role play what a normal client might have prepared going into meetings with developers, that is, very little. Work with your team to create a recommendation for what you will build for the client (the planning documents).

Once the client agrees (with alterations), make your initial sprint plans and milestones and show those to your client.

Now start building your sprints. Your project should be completely done by end of week 3 of the course.

## Timeline - 2 Weeks

1. Monday - Planning Documents - User Narratives, Wireframes, ERD, Sprint Plan
