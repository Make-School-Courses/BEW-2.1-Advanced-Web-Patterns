# Famous Amos' Pets Emporium

## Intro

You just got a contract with Famous Amos' Pets Emporium to build their pet store website!

## First Steps:

Your first step is to fork and clone down [the repo](https://github.com/Product-College-Labs/pets-emporium-js) of where they are today.

Once you have the project running locally on your computer. Pair up and make a plan for what tests you want to write. Now start to implement your tests solo.

## Their Requests

Here's what Amos wants:

1. Be able to upload images of pets.
1. To see what the pet is doing right now without reloading the page.
1. Be able to purchase pets with credit card and paypal.
1. Be able to search for pets by name, species, and description text.

As a good software developer you also want to make sure that their code has a baseline of test coverage.
