**Check out this [LiteBrite Demo](https://litebrite.live/)!**

- Keep one tab on the demo
- In another tab open the **Play Now** Link
- Follow the instructions in the Repl.it to manipulate the Lite Brite!

Any thoughts?

Let's talk about it!

## WebSocket History

Before we jump into building with websockets, lets take a second to look at where the WebSocket standard came from and how it works. Much of this complexity is buried into the libraries and tools we use, so lets take a minute to look at them.

As HTML5 was being developed, it became clear that the web needed a bidirectional **full-duplex** standard to allow for bidirectional communication.

<!-- v -->

## What was that?

![phone](phone.jpg)

### Bidirectional full-duplex!

- **Bidirectional**: communication happens two-ways: both parties can send and recieve messages
- **Full-Duplex**: sending and receiving can happen _simultaneously!_
    - When you call on your phone someone, that's a bidirectional full-duplex communication system! You both can talk listen simultaneously

<!-- v -->

## Back to WebSockets

**WebSockets work the same way as your phone!** They allow a client (i.e. phone) and a server to have bidirectional full-duplex communication!

### Question

How did this work with the LiteBrite demo we did earlier?

<!-- > -->

### HTML5 Bidirectional Communication => WebSocket

A new standard called WebSocket was recommended in June of 2008 by Michael Carter‚Äîan influential HTML5 game developer.

In February 2010, Google (being a champion of HTML5) made Chrome 4 the first browser to ship a full support of the standard and enabled by default with Safari 5.0.0 in a close second. The last was Internet Explorer 10 in December 2011.

The WebSocket standard begins with an **HTTP handshake**, but then switches to the **WebSocket Standard (WS, or WSS for WebSocket Secure)** that does not conform to the HTTP protocol.

Here's the same diagram, highlighting exactly where the upgrade from HTTP to WS occurs:

Here's an example of how the request for the handshake and the server's response looks:

```txt
GET /chat HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: x3JJHMbDL1EzLkh9GBhXDw==
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
Origin: http://example.com
```

Server response:

```txt
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: HSmrc0sMlYUkAGmm5OPpG2HaGWk=
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat
```

The request sends a `Sec-WebSocket-Key` which contains base64-encoded random bytes, and response responds with with a hash of the key in the `Sec-WebSocket-Accept` attribute which prevents resending old messages. This key/hash pattern does not provide any authentication, privacy, or integrity. WebSocket has unique security and privacy concerns.

For more information read this [WebSocket documentation](https://hpbn.co/websocket/).

## Communication between front and back ends

Back to the LiteBrite...

1. Which component was the front end?
1. Which component was the back end?

## Another Example

**Answer the below questions about this example:**

1. What does the back end do here?
1. What does the front end do here?
1. How is information shared between the back and front ends?

## The Code

In the following tutorial we'll be using [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) one of the most reliable npm modules on the web that enables node servers to respond to event-driven WebSocket behaviors. Socket.io is a broad and powerful library that can manage multiple channels, rooms, and manage https and other forms of security. In our case we will be implementing a simple asynchronous push of data from the server to the client.

Remember that since the client and the server are communicating via WebSockets, Socket.io will have client and server-side libraries that you will need to initialize in your project. A simple example is as follows:

```html
<!-- CLIENT -->
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script>
  var socket = io('http://localhost');

  socket.emit('ferret', 'tobi', function (data) {
    console.log(data); // data will be 'woot'
  });
</script>
```

```js
// SERVER
var io = require('socket.io-client')('http://localhost');
io.on('connection', function (socket) {
  socket.on('ferret', function (name, fn) {
    fn('woot');
  });
});
```

<!-- v -->

Hint: If you are starting your server you need to include io in that server.

> **NOTE** - `broadcast.emit()` and `emit()` are different. `emit()` sends to all attached sockets, `broadcast.emit()` sends to all except the one that is sending the message.

```js
// SERVER
var app = require('express')();
var http = require('http').Server(app);
var io = require('socket.io')(http);

app.get('/', function(req, res){
  res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
});

io.on('connection', function(socket){
  console.log('a user connected');
});

http.listen(3000, function(){
  console.log('listening on *:3000');
});
```
