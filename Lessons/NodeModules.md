## [**20m**] ‚òÄÔ∏è Warmup: Coding Required

Today, we'll be learning about the inner workings of Node modules. To better understand how modules work, let's dig in to a function we see at the top of every Node file: `require`!

> Node was the first environment to offer a way to organize code in modules by using a special function called `require()`. How does it work? Let‚Äôs try to implement it from zero.

Follow [Michele Nasti](https://michelenasti.com/)'s guide _"[Let's write our simple version of the require() function](https://michelenasti.com/2018/10/02/let-s-write-a-simple-version-of-the-require-function.html)"_ in your breakout room.

## [**30m**] üí¨ **TT**: NPM

### What is NPM?

<img src="Lessons/assets/package.png" width="400" />

NPM is a company that promotes open source development for all things JavaScript! What they're most known for though, is the **Node Package Manager** (also NPM) which allows for the easy installation of JavaScript modules.

### What is a Package?

Think of it like a library you're installing to help your project do things! NPM is like Brew but for your JS project!

From [time manipulation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) to [web frameworks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment), to [creating user interfaces](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react), NPM allows your project to take advantage of all sorts of libraries to solve your problems!

<!-- > -->

### What Happens When I Install a Package?

<img src="Lessons/assets/install.jpg" width="400" />

You install packages with NPM by running `npm install <package_name>`. If the folder doesn't already exist, a `node_modules` folder will be added to your project, and all modules installed by NPM will live there.

What you may find though is that a package may have dependencies that it needs to run. So sometimes installing one package means installing many more! Don't worry, NPM will install any dependencies needed for you.

<!-- v -->

### `package.json`

What if your buddy wants to clone or fork your project? He'll have to manually install all those modules. That's a drag.

An easy way to fix this is by having a `package.json` file, which lists all modules that a project needs in order to run. Think of it like a dependency list!

A `package.json` file has two required fields:

* `name`: name of your project/app
* `version`: version number

It will then have a list of `dependencies`, or modules that need to be installed so that the project/app can run. Here's an example:

```json
{
    "name": "secret-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "dependencies": {
        "lodash": "^4.17.11",
        "moment": "^2.29.1"
    }
}
```

<!-- v -->

### What's With the `^` Symbols in Versions?

That means we want the stated version _or higher_ for our project!

Now that we have a `package.json`, all anyone has to do is run `npm install`, and all dependencies listed in `package.json` will be installed!


<!-- > -->

### How Do I Use a Package?

By using the `require` function at the top of any server-side JavaScript file. The `require()` function, `module.exports` and `exports` are APIs of the module system that is specific to Node.js. **Browsers do not implement this module system.**

* `require()` is not part of the standard JavaScript API.
* Built-in function with only one purpose --- to load modules.
* Each module has its own scope.
* To expose values from a module, assign those values to `module.exports`.
* To access another module's exported values (`module.exports`), it must use `require()`.

#### Example

```js
// Load the full build.
var lodash = require('lodash');
```

Now you can call anything in the [lodash library](https://lodash.com) by using the `lodash` variable!

### Useful Commands

* `which npm` ‚Äì where npm was installed
* `npm --version` ‚Äì which version of npm you have
* `npm install <package_name>` ‚Äì install a package, or run without the package name to install everything in the `package.json` file
* `npm install -g <package_name>` ‚Äì installs the package as a global package (available from the command line)
* `npm install <package_name> --save-dev` ‚Äì install a package that is only needed for development. For example, it can be any package for testing the project.
* `npm list` ‚Äì list of npm packages installed
* `npm init` ‚Äì creates a `package.json` file for you! Packages installed will be automatically added
* `npm update <package_name>` ‚Äì updates a package (or all packages if none are specified)
* `npm uninstall <package_name>` ‚Äì uninstalls a package
* `npm help` ‚Äì if you need help with npm!

### Deploying Your Modules

#### Why Should I Deploy a Module?

<img src="Lessons/assets/open_source.png" width="400" />

* Help out other programmers that may need to solve a similar problem
* Contribute to Open Source and participate in the community
* Make it easy to install a Node program in any new environment without cloning and running the code first.

#### How Do I Deploy?

Follow [this quick guide](https://www.jamesqquick.com/blog/how-to-create-and-publish-npm-packages) to deploy your first module!

**The hardest part will be coming up with a unique name!**

## [**15m**] üëÄ **Demo**: Tocsify

Let's go through an example of an NPM module built by Dani: [Tocsify](https://github.com/droxey/tocsify)

## [**60m**] üíª **Activity**: Create a Node Module

Now it's your turn to create more node modules! Take some time to create modules that do the following:

1. Write a random number generator module
1. Write a module that removes all spaces from a string  and replaces them with dashes (-)
1. Write a module of your choosing!

**Stretch challenges:** Pick an idea from the following lists, and create a module for it!
