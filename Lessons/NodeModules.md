## Warmup

- Head to [NPM's website](https://www.npmjs.com/) and search the packages for the most unique/entertaining/creative package you can find!
- Report back your finding!

## What is NPM?

NPM is a company that promotes open source development for all things JavaScript! What they're most known for though, is the **Node Package Manager** (also NPM) which allows for the easy installation of JavaScript modules.

### What is a package?

Think of it like a library you're installing to help your project do things! NPM is like Brew but for your JS project!

From [time manipulation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) to [web frameworks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment), to [creating user interfaces](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react), NPM allows your project to take advantage of all sorts of libraries to solve your problems!

## What Happens When I Install a Package?

<img src="assets/install.jpg" width="400" />

You install packages with NPM by running `npm install <package_name>`. If the folder doesn't already exist, a `node_modules` folder will be added to your project, and all modules installed by NPM will live there.

What you may find though is that a package may have dependencies that it needs to run. So sometimes installing one package means installing many more! Don't worry, NPM will install any dependencies needed for you.

### package.json

What if your buddy wants to clone or fork your project? He'll have to manually install all those modules. That's a drag.

An easy way to fix this is by having a `package.json` file, which lists all modules that a project needs in order to run. Think of it like a dependency list!

A `package.json` file has two required fields:

- `name`: name of your project/app
- `version`: version number

It will then have a list of `dependencies`, or modules that need to be installed so that the project/app can run. Here's an example:

```
{
    "name": "secret-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "dependencies": {
        "lodash": "^4.17.11",
        "moment": "^2.29.1"
    }
}
```

<!-- v -->

### What was the "^" for the version numbers for?

That means we want the stated version _or higher_ for our project!

Now that we have a `package.json`, all anyone has to do is run `npm install`, and all dependencies listed in `package.json` will be installed!

## How do I Use a Package?

By using the `require` method!

`var lodash = require('lodash')`

Now you can call anything in the lodash library by using the lodash variable!

## Useful Commands

- `which npm` ‚Äì where npm was installed
- `npm --version` ‚Äì which version of npm you have
- `npm install <package_name>` ‚Äì install a package, or run without the package name to install everything in the `package.json` file
- `npm install -g <package_name>` ‚Äì installs the package as a global package (available from the command line)
- `npm install <package_name> --save-dev` ‚Äì install a package that is only needed for development. For example, it can be any package for testing the project.
- `npm list` ‚Äì list of npm packages installed
- `npm init` ‚Äì creates a `package.json` file for you! Packages installed will be automatically added
- `npm update <package_name>` ‚Äì updates a package (or all packages if none are specified)
- `npm uninstall <package_name>` ‚Äì uninstalls a package
- `npm help` ‚Äì if you need help with npm!

## Deploying Your Modules

### How Do I Deploy?

Follow [this quick guide](https://www.jamesqquick.com/blog/how-to-create-and-publish-npm-packages) to deploy your first module! The hardest part will be coming up with a unique name!

Let's go through an example of an NPM module built by Dani!

## Create a Node Module!

Now it's your turn to create more node modules! Take some time to create modules that do the following:

1. Write a random number generator module
1. Write a module that removes all spaces from a string  and replaces them with dashes (-)
1. Write a module of your choosing!

**Stretch challenges:** Pick an idea from the following lists, and create a module for it!
