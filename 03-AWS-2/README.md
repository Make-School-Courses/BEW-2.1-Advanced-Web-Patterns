## [**30m**] 💻 **Activity**: Serverless Hello World

First, be sure to set up your credentials for AWS using the docs: [Serverless Framework - AWS Lambda Guide - Credentials](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/)

Then, get hands-on with your first serverless application by running the [Hello World Node.js Example on AWS](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/examples/hello-world/node/) in your own terminal.

Once it's working, modify the code to return you and your partner's names instead!

## [**30m**] 💻 **Activity**: Serverless Full Stack

Learn multiple ways to deploy and configure websites on AWS by completing the [Full-Stack Application Development on AWS](https://www.serverless.com/learn/courses/full-stack-application-development-on-aws) video course in pairs.

This tutorial will take approximately two hours to complete --- start working on it now, and we'll have time in class to continue working on it before it's due next Monday!

<!-- > -->

## [**10m**] 🔄 **Recap**: Full Stack Progress + Homework

Finish the tutorial with your partner as homework. When done, submit the deployed URL to your full stack application on [Gradescope](https://make.sc/bew2.1-gradescope).

Remember, this assignment is due next Monday before class! Finish it to prepare for our guest speaker.
