# Node Modules Under the Hood

## Objectives

* Explain how Node Modules work.
* Customize a node module.
* Make your own Node Module.

## Backgrounds

We've been using npm and Node Modules this whole time. But what are they exactly and how can you make your own?

## Detecting Patterns

1. In teams of 3, open up a bunch of random npm folders. What are files and folders they have in common? What are files and folders they don't share?
1. Look into the `package.json` files of some modules. What is are the differences between that `package.json` file and the ones in your express projects?
1. Look into some of the modules' `index.js` files. What is their structure? How are they different from your `server.js` files?

## Challenges

1. Follow [tmpvar's instructions for building and shipping a new npm module](https://gist.github.com/tmpvar/8746055)
1. Now brainstorm in groups of 4 a module you could build. 
1. Each person pick one and design what steps you would take to build the module. 
1. Build the module you designed! (optional)
1. Explore some node modules, download their source code and see if you can make some improvements.
