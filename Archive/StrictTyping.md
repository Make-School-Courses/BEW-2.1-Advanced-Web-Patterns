## Activity: What to Do?

_The following scenario is a REAL scenario that was happening in real-time 4 months ago at a major, billion-dollar startup. The team of engineers who had to make this decision was only about 8 people, so today's exercise should be similar to their exact process._

### Instructions

1. Break into teams of 8
1. Read the scenario carefully
1. Start a "Decision Document" for your team
1. Research the various options and solutions to the problem of Type Errors
1. List the options your team would like to use, and list pros and cons (There is no limit to the resources you can use to pick the best solution.)
1. Decide as a group on one recommended path forward.
1. Make a "hello world" example of your recommendation.
1. Convert part or all of Pete's Pets to the path your team recommended.

### Scenario

> **Scenario** - You the backend engineers of a widely used website. Your backend is built in Node.js/Express.js and your front end is React.js. The mobile team is fighting over using React Native or native iOS/Android right now, but you, on the backend, have another debate brewing. The question is about **Type Errors**.

> You are starting to experience more and more production error due to type mis-match. The codebase started out with nothing at all, just JavaScript and some tests and documentation, but as things get more and more complex and large and the team grows, a cadre of engineers regretted that the codebase was written in a scripted and dynamically typed language, since these give rise to more **type errors** in production when a code base is large. They debated rewriting the codebase in a strictly typed, compiled language, but this was shut down by the founder. Various factions are forming that support tools like **Flow**, **TypeScript**, or support just making a more robust **styleguide** and maybe a **custom linter**. What will your team decide?

> Remember there is no right answer here. Companies are making this decision across the internet right now and they are all deciding differently.

## Homework (Optional)

You can write a blog post about your experience and publish it. This topic is very popular and your post will be met with interest on Medium!

This activity is in the style of **Inquery Based Learning**. Use learning experiences like this when you are given the opportunity to teach or facilitate a group. They are much more fun and successful than just talking at people.
